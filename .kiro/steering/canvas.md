# Canvas Architecture

## Overview

The infinite canvas system is a core feature of Unit {set}, providing a Figma-like drawing and design experience. It uses **React Context + useReducer** for state management with a clean, Redux-free architecture that maintains full functionality while improving TypeScript integration and simplifying the codebase.

## Architecture Components

### 1. State Management (`contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`)

The canvas uses two separate reducers for clean separation of concerns:

- **Viewport Reducer**: Manages pan, zoom, and viewport mode
- **Shapes Reducer**: Manages drawing entities, selection, tools, and history

```typescript
// Context provides:
- viewport: ViewportState
- dispatchViewport: React.Dispatch<ViewportAction>
- shapes: ShapesState
- dispatchShapes: React.Dispatch<ShapesAction>
- shapesList: Shape[] (computed from normalized entity state)
- defaultProperties: ShapeDefaultProperties (stroke, color, corner defaults)
- setDefaultProperty: (property: string, value: unknown) => void
```

### 2. Core Types (`types/canvas.ts`)

**Viewport Types:**

- `ViewportState`: scale, translate, mode, pan tracking
- `ViewportMode`: "idle" | "panning" | "shiftPanning"

**Shape Types:**

- `FrameShape`: Rectangular frames with auto-incrementing numbers
- `RectShape`: Basic rectangles with optional border radius
- `EllipseShape`: Ellipses
- `FreeDrawShape`: Freehand paths with point arrays
- `ArrowShape`: Arrows with start/end points
- `LineShape`: Straight lines
- `TextShape`: Text with full typography controls
- `GeneratedUIShape`: AI-generated UI components
- `ScreenShape`: AI screen shapes linked to Convex records

**Tool Types:**

- `Tool`: "select" | "hand" | "frame" | "rect" | "ellipse" | "freedraw" | "arrow" | "line" | "text" | "eraser" | "screen"

**State Structure:**

- Normalized entity state: `{ ids: string[], entities: Record<string, Shape> }`
- Selection map: `Record<string, true>` for O(1) lookup
- History: `HistoryEntry[]` with pointer for undo/redo

## Interaction Patterns

### Pan & Zoom

**Pan:**

- Middle mouse button drag (button 1)
- Right mouse button drag (button 2)
- Space + left mouse button drag (temporary hand tool)
- Hand tool + left mouse button drag
- Mouse wheel (horizontal/vertical with Shift modifier)
- Wheel event listener with passive: false for preventDefault

**Zoom:**

- Ctrl/Cmd + mouse wheel (zooms around cursor position)
- Zoom in/out buttons (1.2x factor)
- Reset zoom button (resets to 1.0 scale around canvas center)
- Zoom to fit button (fits all shapes in viewport with padding)
- Pinch-to-zoom on trackpads (via ctrlKey detection)
- Adaptive sensitivity: trackpad (0.25) vs mouse wheel (0.05)

### Drawing Tools

**Select Tool:**

- Click to select shape (clears previous selection unless Shift held)
- Shift+click to add/remove from selection
- Drag to move selected shapes (stores initial positions for all selected)
- Drag on empty space for selection box (multi-select)
- Click empty space to deselect all
- Double-click text shapes to enter edit mode
- Smart hit detection: prefers smaller shapes when nested

**Shape Tools (Frame, Rect, Ellipse, Arrow, Line):**

- Click and drag to draw
- Draft preview during drawing
- Auto-switch to select tool after drawing
- Applies default properties (stroke color, width, type, corner radius)

**Freedraw Tool:**

- Click and drag to draw freehand
- RAF throttling for smooth rendering
- Auto-switch to select tool after drawing
- Applies default stroke color and type

**Text Tool:**

- Click to place text at cursor position
- Auto-switch to select tool after placement
- Sidebar auto-opens for typography controls
- Double-click text to edit
- Text dimensions auto-calculated on creation
- Supports full typography: font family, size, weight, style, alignment, decoration, line height, letter spacing, text transform

**Screen Tool:**

- Click to place AI screen at cursor position
- Creates linked Convex screen record
- Opens AI sidebar for generation

**Eraser Tool:**

- Click or drag to erase shapes
- Tracks erased shapes in Set to prevent double-deletion during drag
- Uses hit testing with allowBoundsFallback: false for precise erasing
- Clears erased shapes Set on pointer up

### Selection & Movement

- Click shape to select (clears previous selection unless Shift held)
- Shift+click to add to selection
- Drag selected shapes to move (all selected shapes move together)
- Stores initial positions for all selected shapes in ref
- Calculates delta from move start and applies to all shapes
- Supports moving all shape types: frames, rects, ellipses, freedraw, arrows, lines, text, generatedui, screen
- Movement preserves shape structure (points for freedraw, start/end for lines/arrows)
- History batching: entire move operation is single undo entry

### Resizing

- Bounding box shows 8 resize handles for selected shapes (corners: nw, ne, sw, se; edges: n, s, e, w)
- Custom DOM events for resize communication:
  - `shape-resize-start`: Initiates resize with shapeId, corner, bounds, clientX/Y
  - `shape-resize-move`: Updates shape during resize with clientX/Y
  - `shape-resize-end`: Finalizes resize and clears resize data
- Supports all shape types with appropriate transformations:
  - Frames, rects, ellipses, generatedui, screen: Direct x, y, w, h updates
  - Freedraw: Scales points proportionally within new bounds
  - Arrows/lines: Special handling for line-start and line-end handles, scales diagonal lines
  - Text: Proportional scaling of font size, line height, letter spacing
- Minimum size constraint: 10px width and height
- Resize data stored in ref to prevent re-renders
- History batching: entire resize operation is single undo entry

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Implemented:**

- **Space**: Enable hand tool (temporary pan with left mouse, shows grab cursor)
- **Delete/Backspace**: Delete selected shapes (disabled in text inputs)
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Z**: Undo last action
- **Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z** or **Ctrl/Cmd+Y**: Redo last undone action
- **Ctrl/Cmd+C**: Copy selected shapes to clipboard
- **Ctrl/Cmd+V**: Paste shapes from clipboard (centers at cursor position)
- **S**: Select tool
- **H**: Hand tool
- **F**: Frame tool
- **R**: Rectangle tool
- **C**: Ellipse tool (Circle)
- **L**: Line tool
- **A**: Arrow tool
- **D**: Freedraw tool (Draw)
- **T**: Text tool
- **E**: Eraser tool

**TODO:**

- **Escape**: Clear selection
- **Ctrl/Cmd+A**: Select all
- **Ctrl/Cmd+D**: Duplicate

## Performance Optimizations

1. **RAF Throttling**: Freehand drawing throttled to 8ms intervals
2. **RAF Batching**: Pan operations batched with requestAnimationFrame
3. **Refs for Non-Reactive State**: Interaction state stored in refs to prevent re-renders
4. **Memoized Computed Values**: `shapesList` computed with useMemo
5. **Immutable State Updates**: Spread operators for efficient updates
6. **Normalized Entity State**: O(1) lookups by ID
7. **Debounced Auto-Save**: 1-second debounce for localStorage
8. **History Batching**: Move/resize operations batched into single history entries

## Best Practices

### When Adding New Shape Types

1. Add type definition to `types/canvas.ts`
2. Create factory function in `lib/canvas/shape-factories.ts`
3. Add action and case to `lib/canvas/shapes-reducer.ts`
4. Add hit testing logic to `lib/canvas/hit-testing.ts`
5. Create shape component in `components/canvas/shapes/`
6. Create preview component for draft rendering
7. Add rendering logic to canvas page
8. Update `layers-sidebar-utils.ts` with icon and name

### When Adding New Tools

1. Add tool type to `Tool` union in `types/canvas.ts`
2. Add tool button to `Toolbar.tsx`
3. Add interaction logic to `use-infinite-canvas.ts` (onPointerDown, onPointerMove, onPointerUp)
4. Handle draft shape rendering if applicable (add preview component)
5. Add cursor styling to `cursor-utils.ts` TOOL_CURSOR_MAP
6. Add keyboard shortcut to TOOL_HOTKEYS in `use-infinite-canvas.ts`
7. Update shapes reducer if new shape type is needed
8. Update `properties-utils.ts` if tool has configurable properties

### When Adding New Properties

1. Add property type to `properties-utils.ts`
2. Create control component in `components/canvas/property-controls/`
3. Export from `property-controls/index.ts`
4. Add to `getControlsForTool` and `getControlsForShapes`
5. Update `ShapePropertiesBar.tsx` to render the control
6. Update shape factories to accept the property
7. Update `defaultProperties` in `CanvasContext.tsx`

### When Modifying State

- Always use dispatch actions, never mutate state directly
- Use immutable updates with spread operators
- Keep reducers pure (no side effects)
- Store interaction state in refs, not state (prevents re-renders)
- Use RAF for performance-critical operations
- Use `meta: { skipHistory: true }` for intermediate updates during drag operations
- Call `PUSH_HISTORY` at the end of batched operations

### When Adding Persistence

- Update `serializeCanvasState` and `deserializeCanvasState`
- Test localStorage save/load
- Implement Convex mutations/queries when ready
- Handle migration for schema changes
- Consider history truncation for storage limits

## Testing

```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
pnpm tsc --noEmit

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Test canvas in development
pnpm dev
# Navigate to /dashboard/[projectId]/canvas
```

## Implementation Details

### Event Handling

- Uses pointer events (not mouse events) for better touch support
- Pointer capture for reliable drag operations
- Prevents default on non-button elements
- Allows interaction with buttons and textareas
- Wheel event listener with passive: false for zoom/pan control

### State Management Strategy

- **Viewport state**: Managed by viewport reducer (pan, zoom, mode)
- **Shapes state**: Managed by shapes reducer (entities, selection, tool, history)
- **Interaction state**: Stored in refs (draft shapes, movement, resizing)
- **UI state**: Local component state (sidebar, force updates)
- **Default properties**: Managed in context (stroke, color, corners)
- Refs prevent re-renders during high-frequency interactions

### History Management

- History entries contain: shapes, selected, frameCounter, timestamp
- Pointer-based navigation (undo decrements, redo increments)
- Forward history truncated on new action
- Max size limiting with oldest entry removal
- Batched operations use `skipHistory` meta flag
- Manual `PUSH_HISTORY` for batch completion

### Performance Considerations

- RAF throttling for freehand drawing (8ms = ~120fps)
- RAF batching for pan operations
- Refs for interaction state (no re-renders)
- Memoized shapes list computation
- Immutable state updates with spread operators
- Normalized entity state for O(1) lookups
- Debounced auto-save (1 second)
- History batching reduces memory usage

## Migration Notes

This implementation uses a modern React architecture:

- React Context instead of Redux store
- useReducer instead of Redux Toolkit slices
- Custom entity adapter instead of @reduxjs/toolkit createEntityAdapter
- Direct dispatch calls instead of Redux actions
- Hooks-based architecture with clear separation of concerns

All functionality is preserved while simplifying the architecture and improving TypeScript integration.
